## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?
- Working on challenges
- Arranging team meetings
- Finishing most review topics on time took longer than expected.
- Meeting plans
- Selecting coding challenges and writing the solutions; 


### What parts of your plan did not work out?
- Completing the challenges on time
- Planning to have more PR meetings, but we did not create a clear plan or initial slots for that.


### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?
- Follow up with any team member who is not active in GitHub for 2 days(if necessary) to support and help.


### Or remove extra steps?
Clean up the repository from all the unnecessary files (e.g., c++ version of the problems; put them in a separate branch?!) because the repo was quite overwhelming esp. for those that are new to GitHub.

## Deletions to Make Valid Parentheses

The `deletions_to_make_valid_parentheses` function is a Python implementation to determine the number of deletions required to make a given string of parentheses valid. Valid parentheses are defined by ensuring that for every opening parenthesis '(', there is a corresponding closing parenthesis ')'.

### Usage

```python
result = deletions_to_make_valid_parentheses("(()()()")
print(result)
```

### Function Signature

```python
def deletions_to_make_valid_parentheses(s: str) -> int:
```

### Parameters

- `s`: A string containing parentheses.

### Return

- The function returns an integer representing the minimum number of deletions needed to make the parentheses valid.

### Implementation Details

- **Base Case:** If the length of the input string is less than or equal to 1, the function returns the length of the string as the number of deletions required.

- The function employs a counter (`inValidParentheses`) to keep track of the balance between opening and closing parentheses. For every opening parenthesis encountered, the counter is incremented, and for every closing parenthesis, it is decremented.

- The final result is the absolute value of the counter, representing the minimum number of deletions needed to balance the parentheses.

### Example

For the input string `"(()()()"`, the function would return `1`, indicating that one closing parenthesis needs to be deleted to make the string valid.

### Note

- The function is designed to work with strings containing only parentheses. Any other characters present in the string are ignored.

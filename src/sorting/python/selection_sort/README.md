**Selection Sort Implementation in Python**

The `selectionsort_v1` function is a Python implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm. It takes an array `arr` as input and sorts it in ascending order using the Selection Sort technique. The algorithm works by iteratively finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and swapping it with the first element of the unsorted part.

**Usage:**

```python
sorted_array = selectionsort_v1(my_array)
```

**Function Signature:**

```python
def selectionsort_v1(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
```

**Parameters:**
- `arr`: The input list to be sorted.

**Returns:**
- A new list containing the sorted elements of the input array.

**Base Case:**
- If the length of the array is 0 or 1, the function returns the array as it is considered sorted.

**Note:**
- The initial implementation provided was not a correct representation of Selection Sort. The corrected version includes a nested loop to find the minimum element's index and uses tuple unpacking for in-place swapping without a third variable.
